# Remappable Pins
Code Samples For MikroC using the PIC Microcontroller

PIC16F18345

The PIC16F18345 is a 20 PIN device with remappable PINs. Remappable pins, as the name suggests enables the user to re-direct the output or input of a peripheral to a different PIN. To perform this action, the PPS module is accessed, and the MikroC compiler supports this. There is an issues with the PPS module and the code sample includes the updated version of the file and a code sample to demonstrate the use.
